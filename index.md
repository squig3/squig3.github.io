Dream Dining: Disco! is a small experimental game combining rhythm, and cooking elements. The player must serve a burger the correct customer order, but every input has to be on-beat with the music. The goal is to serve as many customers as accurately as possible before the song ends. This is one of the games made in Scratch, before moving on to Unity Development.  
In terms of programming and design, the hardest part was deciding how to score the player's burger. I wanted the player to be rewarded for getting ingredients in the correct order, so I settled on a system that counts the differences between the customer order and the player's dish, with each difference subtracting from the score. This meant that players would still receive a "good" rating, so long as the ingredients were correct, even if they were in the wrong order, while players would have to have 0 differences to receive a "perfect" rating.  
I wanted the game to feel somewhat frantic and hectic, so I made the amount of customers served a large factor in the final score, players would not be rewarded as much for high accuracy if they only served a couple customers. This encouraged that players would try to make an input on every beat, to amplify the rhythm aspect of the game.

## Music
Almost all music is chiptune music, done in Famitracker 0CC.

### Pirate Pearl
Pirate Pearl is a light-hearted RPG platformer by another developer, which I wrote the soundtrack for. This is the main gameplay loop, which is what the player hears for most of the duration of the game.
