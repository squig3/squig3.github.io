Dream Dining: Disco! is a very small experimental arcade game combining rhythm, and cooking elements. The player must serve a burger the correct customer order, but every input has to be on-beat with the music. The goal is to serve as many customers as accurately as possible before the song ends. This is one of the games I made in Scratch, before moving on to Unity Development.  
All pixel art made in Aseprite, music in FL Studio 20.

### Cabra

Cabra is a game I've been working on slowly over the past few years in Unity. It's based around a metroidvania style of gameplay, focused on exploration, narrative and combat.
All pixel art made in Aseprite, level design in Tiled, sound effects and music in Famitracker 0CC.

### Noreidia

Noreidia is a small top-down exploration based-RPG very inspired by the original Legend of Zelda. I've been developing it for the past couple months in Unity, alongside Cabra.
I expect to finish it sometime by the beginning of 2021.
All pixel art made in Aseprite, music and sounds in Famitracker 0CC, and level design in Tiled.

## Music
Music is primarily chiptune music, done in Famitracker 0CC, but occasionally I'll do more electronic music in FL Studio or pxTone Collage.

### Pirate Pearl
Pirate Pearl is a light-hearted RPG platformer by another developer, which I wrote the soundtrack for. This is the main gameplay loop, which is what the player hears for most of the duration of the game. Written in Famitracker 0CC.

### Original Famitracker Demo
This is another original track that I wrote, not for a game but to showcase some variety in composition.
Written in Famitracker 0CC.
